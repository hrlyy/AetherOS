## **Manifesto**

We’re building for those who were never handed the tools.  
The ones who can’t afford the luxury of MacBooks or expensive distros.  
The ones who open Chrome on a school Chromebook and still dream big.  

**AetherOS** is more than a WebOS.  

It's not a toy. Not a demo. Not a dev sandbox.  
A system meant for **everyone**.  

If your hardware says no — **AetherOS says yes.**  
If your budget says wait — **AetherOS says now.**  
If the industry says "you can’t" — we say **"watch us."**

**AnuraOS & Terbium are nothing compared to what AetherOS will be.**

We are:
- Fighting gatekeeping with free access  
- Turning any device with a browser into a full workstation  
- Blending real OS functionality with the power of the web  
- Making something useful, beautiful, and *built to last*  

This isn’t about emulation. It’s about **elevation.**  
AetherOS is the people’s OS. Lightweight, terminal-powered, customizable, cloud-connected.

And it's just getting started.

**This is AetherOS.**  
**No install. No cost. No excuses.**
