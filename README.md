## **Manifesto**

AetherOS is not just a terminal. It's not just a window manager.  
It’s a **real operating system**, reborn in the browser — designed for speed, simplicity, and **freedom**.  

A fusion of:
- macOS’s elegance  
- Linux’s open power  
- Arch’s minimalism and modular control  

Accessible to anyone with a browser.  
Lightweight, full-featured, and ready to *replace* bloated systems — not just emulate them.

**AetherOS is the last OS you'll need on underpowered hardware.**  
It’s not about playing pretend. It’s about making computing universal.  

You don’t install it — you just use it.  
You don’t fight it — you shape it.  
You don’t wait for permission — you build your own future.

**AetherOS is the people’s OS.**  
Minimalist. Fast. Modular. Universal.
